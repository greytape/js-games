# Welcome

This is a site that contains learning resources for learning how to program simple web games in Javascript.

## How to use this site

The site contains step-by-step tutorials that you can work through, as well as how-to-guides that explain simple concepts that you'll need to complete the tutorials. If you already have some experience programming in Javascript, you might not need the how-to guides.

Where possible, we try to link to existing resources, rather than creating them from scratch.
