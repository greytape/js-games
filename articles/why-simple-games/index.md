# Why simple games?

This site attempts to teach coding by buiding simple games. Often, we use games from the 1970s and 80s as a starting point. But why?

### Games development today

A lot of people want to be computer game developers. Computer games nowadays are big business. Creating a best selling game today can involve [hundreds of developers](https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/06/call-of-duty-consumes-the-time-of-four-or-five-activision-studios-video/).

In the 1970s and 80s things were different. The best selling game of of 1984 in the UK, [Jet Set Willy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Willy), was created by [just one guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Smith_(games_programmer)). (You can play a version of Jet Set Willy online [here](https://www.playdosgames.com/online/jet-set-willy/)).

There are still [solo game developers working today](https://www.keengamer.com/articles/features/opinion-pieces/what-does-it-take-to-be-a-solo-games-developer/). They tend to make simpler games, often known as [indie games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game). However, while indie games are simpler than their big-budget, they are much more technically sophisticated than games from the 1970s and 80s. This is because the tools that we use to build and share games have improved immeasurably (for example, [higher-level programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)). 

### Taking advantage of these tools

So it is much easier to build games today than it was 40 years ago. This means as novice developers, we can create fun games relatively easily, games which would have been state of the arts in the 1970s and 80s.
