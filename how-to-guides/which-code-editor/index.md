# Which code editor should I use?

If you are just starting out, I recommend using an online development environment. These allow you to go from writing code to seeing it in a browser in minutes. I recommend [Replit](https://www.replit.com), but there are a bunch of others out there that you might want to try.

Replit not only provides you with a place to write and save code, it also hosts your project so you can easily view the final product in a web browser, and share it with others.

### Something a bit more powerful

If you have a bit more experience, and are looking to create more complex projects, it is worth setting up a development environment on your own computer. You'll have a lot more control here, as the files that you are writing are on your own computer, and you can do what you want with them.

The industry standard tool for writing code is probably [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com). It is also very easy to use, and great for beginners.

Hosting files is a bit more complex when you are developing locally, but not much. A tool I recommend for sharing your projects with others is [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) (this site is hosted on github pages).
